# OpenGL Voxel Game
This project is my second ever project using OpenGL. This time, its written in Java and GLSL, instead of C, C++, and GLSL.
I am turning it into some sort of voxel game, like Minecraft. I was following the tutorial series [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMWUjNE0fYI&list=PLRIWtICgwaX0u7Rf9zkZhLoLuZVfUksDP&index=0) for lots of info. Right now I am in the stage of working on shaders and whatnot.

I will work on documenting the files as well when I have the time. Docs coming soon (tm)
