# OpenGL Render Engine

This project is my second ever project using OpenGL. This time, its written in Java and GLSL, instead of C, C++, and GLSL.
I will most likely turn it into a voxel engine, but right now, I am following the tutorial series [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMWUjNE0fYI&list=PLRIWtICgwaX0u7Rf9zkZhLoLuZVfUksDP&index=0).

I will work on documenting the files as well once I finish the tutorial series.
